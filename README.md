## AWSupabase Hackathon Submission

A personalized AI tutor powered by LLMs. The main feature is the image to speech function. Inputs are powerpoint slides and outputs are David Attenborough explanations. Currently, there is no limit to the size of the powerpoint presentations.

Why David Attenborough? So that any stress from the user will be soothed by his tender voice. Celebrity voices are easily switched, so if you really want, we can have Sam Altman teach you what a generative AI program is or Conan O'Brien tell you jokes about databases. 

While the software can be used as an AI tutor for students, there are also many other applications for the use of this software.
Including:
1) Dry/Boring Safety Briefings for workplace projects
2) Reviewing presentations that was missed
3) Basically any application of asking a Powerpoint Presentation questions about itself. We already are able to ask a pdf for questions about itself, so why not a powerpoint? The applications are endless and limited by the imagination.
